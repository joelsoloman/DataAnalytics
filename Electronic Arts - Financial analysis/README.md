# Financial Analysis on Electronic Arts

During my education at St. Clair College, I undertook a comprehensive financial analysis project on Electronic Arts (EA). This project involved conducting **Ratio Analysis**, **Technical Analysis**, **Monte Carlo simulation**, and **FB Prophet** forecasting to evaluate the investment potential of EA stock within the *S&P 500*. By examining various financial metrics and parameters, I was able to derive a data-driven conclusion on the stock's performance, providing investors with a well-informed recommendation on whether to buy, hold, or sell EA stock.

*Please check the __jupyter notebook__ for the technical analysis, and the __excel__ file for the ratio analysis. Also Check out the __Report__ for a detailed explaination if interested.*
