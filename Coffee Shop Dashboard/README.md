#Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard

This project is an analysis and visualization of coffee shop sales data. Using Microsoft Excel's pivot tables and pivot charts, a dynamic dashboard was created to generate insights on sales trends, product performance, and customer preferences across various locations.
The first step in this data analytics project was to explore the data, checking for missing or inconsistent data and duplicate values. Fortunately, the data was clean and did not require any cleaning. Feature engineering was then conducted to extract and create new fields from the existing ones, such as 'month', 'hour', 'revenue', and 'day of week'.
Pivot tables were used to further explore the data, and several tables that provided valuable insights were identified and used to create the dashboard.
Key Findings
There is a steady increase in monthly revenue over the six-month period, from $82K to $166K, reflecting the healthy performance of the stores.
The number of customers is consistent throughout the week, indicating a stable customer base.
Higher sales are observed during the morning hours (7â€“10 AM), likely due to the morning commute and break hours. This presents an opportunity to introduce offers to incentivize more spending.
As expected, coffee, tea, and bakery products are the most sold items.
Brewed Chai Tea, Gourmet Brewed Coffee, and Barista Espresso are the top-performing products across all three locations.
Recommendations
Focus on high-performing products, ensuring sufficient stock, and exploring avenues for improvement by variety or availability.
Implement marketing campaigns to capitalize on higher morning traffic.
Explore new strategies to boost sales for underperforming items.
Consider reducing operating hours in the evenings when sales are lower to save costs.
